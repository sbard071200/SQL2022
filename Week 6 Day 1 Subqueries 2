--------------Q3. What was the total order quantity for each order as well as the overall total quantity and average across all orders?

SELECT

  #Subqury 1 to get total quan for all orders
  (SELECT

   FROM

   ) as totQty,
   
   #Subquery 2 is going to get the average quantity across all orders
   (SELECT

    FROM
      `symmetric-aura-337805.styssql.order_items` as ordI
    ) as avgOrditemQty,
   # Subquery 3 is giving the avg across orders 
    (SELECT

     ) as avgOrdQty
     
    
    
    # Sub 1 & 2 used to aggregate across all orders its only averge across all orders and items???
    # There is no GROUP BY in the subqueries so they will aggregate across all rows
# Now the below code code is part of our outer query

FROM
