--Week 9 Day 2 In-Class
--Q1. What are the total product sales and the employee contribution to the product sales?
#The employee table is not shown in the ERD because it serves a different purpose in SaleCo's overall data structure. Use the employee table (not emp) for this problem in addition to any other tables that are shown in the ERD
#Show product code, the product sales as pSales, the employee count as eCount, and the employee contribution as eContrib Employee contribution (eContrib) is the amount of product sales per employee
#Use an in-line view to answer this question
#Sort the results by product sales in descending order

-----Q2. Who are the customers (if any) that purchased both the products with product codes (P_CODE) of 13-Q2/P2 and 23109-HB?
# Show customer codes, customer first names, and customer last names in the result set
#Show the total product quantities for each of the products aliased as follows:
#Alias 13-Q2/P2 total quantity as: _13_Q2P2_Qty
#Alias 23109-HB total quantity as: _23109-HB_Qty
#Sort the customers by CUS_CODE in ascending order
